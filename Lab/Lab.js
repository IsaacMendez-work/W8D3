Write down 5 aspects of databases and SQL that you think are important to software and applications. 
    1. Constraints in SQL are used to specify the limit on the data type of the table. It can be specified while creating or altering the table statement. The sample of constraints are NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, and FOREIGN KEY. 
    2. A primary key in SQL is a column (or collection of columns) or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It uniquely identifies a single row in the table. (Null values not allowed.)
    3. A unique key identifies a single row in the table, with multiple values allowed per table. (Null values allowed.)
    4. Delete command is used to delete a row in a table. You can rollback data after using delete statement. It is a DML command. It is slower than truncate statement.	
    5. Truncate is used to delete all the rows from a table. You cannot rollback data. It is a DDL command. It is faster than deleting. 

Write down 5 questions you have on databases and SQL (stay away from syntax at the moment!).
    1. How does one drop all tables in a given schema?
    2. How does one get the time difference between two date columns?
    3. Can one retrieve only rows X to Y from a table?
    4. How does one code a hierarchical tree-structured query?
    5.  How does one select EVERY Nth row from a table?
